Introducing a brief guide to particle identification using my macros.

0. Copy all files to your workspace
1. Prepare templates on at least 500000 events using MPDidTemplate.C (change paths to yours)
2. Adjust created templates with MPDcreateTemplates.C
3. Now everything is ready to be used in your analysis. All you have to do is include:
    #include "MPDidentify.h"
   and run function identify( Float_t _ptotal, Float_t _dedx, Float_t _m2, Float_t _beta, Int_t _charge) where:
   _ptotal - total momentum
   _dedx - dedx from TPC
   _m2 - m^2 from ToF
   _beta - beta from ToF
   _charge - charge
 Warning: This gives proper results asserting ToF was on. To check whether ToF was on use ToF flag:
   if(track->GetTofFlag()!=6) continue;
 Warning: This method does not return sign. Remember to check it via track->GetCharge();
   
 Example macro: MPDidDST.C
